<h3><a name="PREFATORY_NOTE" id="PREFATORY_NOTE"></a><i>PREFATORY NOTE</i></h3>

<p><i>This play was written at Viareggio in 1893, and passed an eventful
though not unchequered existence for six years before it was produced by
Mrs. Patrick Campbell at the Princess of Wales' Theatre, Kennington, on
June 19, 1899. The version here published is not exactly that which was
acted, though it is much nearer to the acted version than to the
original play as it stood before I had the benefit of Mrs. Campbell's
vivid and helpful criticism.</i></p>

<p><i>I may remark here that the Play never had the ghost of a glimmer of a
conscious political allusion in it; nor did it occur to me, when I put
my Napoleonic hero in the surroundings which seemed to give most scope
to his autocratic and unscrupulous genius, that any sane person would
suppose that I wished to attack the Indian Civil Service. The plays on
my bookshelves teem with villains of the most diverse professions, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>kings and clergymen&mdash;chiefly, I must confess, Roman Catholics or
Dissenters&mdash;to lawyers and journalists. I do not think I should chafe at
the appearance of a villanous Professor of Greek. And on the whole I
cannot help hoping that those of my critics and friends who adopted a
high patriotic tone against this play, will upon reflection be inclined
to agree that their imperial sensitiveness was a little overstrained.</i></p>

darken the recess.</i>]&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> Now, I must let the light fall full on your

<p>Not a thing! That's a picture of a typical healthy eye. You are quite
uninteresting, you and Father both!</p>

<p>I don't see how <i>his</i> eyes can be uninteresting.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Vera.</span></p>

<p>From Dr. Rheinhardt's point of view, quite. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> are two abnormal ones.

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>You see the depression of that line? That man died insane in two years.
If ever one saw that, one would know&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Breaks off.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you
say?</p>

I think you are really a little unkind about my eagles.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Vera.</span></p>

<p>I can't think why father ever gave you such horrid things!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth.</span></p>

<p>I dare say I shouldn't care for them so much if he hadn't given them to
me. But really, Vera, they are such splendid great things, with their
fierce eyes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Vera.</span></p>

<p>This afternoon.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Adene.</span></p>

<p>I am glad. I want to ask him for some advice and some introductions. I'm
going to India.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Vera.</span></p>

<p>What!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Adene.</span></p>

<p>The fact is, I feel rather run down, and I'm going to take a
holiday&mdash;with a little work to fill in spare moments.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Vera.</span></p>

<p>I know your idea of a holiday: twelve hours a day at a new subject
instead of ten at an old one!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Adene.</span></p>

<p>I'm going to Rajpoor, your father's old province: and I want specially
to get up into the mountains, to the scene of his great exploits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Vera.</span></p>

<p>To Bhoj&#226;l! You'll find that difficult. But why in the world are you
going?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Adene.</span></p>

<p>You know I've been working for some years at Indian dialects?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Vera.</span></p>

<p>Yes; you sent us your book. Father said he couldn't imagine where you
had learnt all those languages.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Adene.</span></p>

<p>Where? Why at "Stratford-atte-Bow!"&nbsp;&nbsp;[<span class="smcap">Vera</span> <i>looks inquiringly</i>.]&nbsp;&nbsp;More
precisely at Limehouse. All nationalities come in course of time to
London Docks. But Bhoj&#226;li is my last acquisition&mdash;since my book. I came
across my Bhoj&#226;li by accident a year ago. And now I can talk pretty well
with him.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Vera.</span></p>

<p>Then, all the more, why go to Bhoj&#226;l?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Adene.</span></p>

<p>Well, you see, it is history rather than philology that I have in mind
for the moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Vera.</span></p>

<p>Not the history of Bhoj&#226;l?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Adene.</span></p>

<p>The history of the Indian Frontier&mdash;from the native's point of view!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Vera.</span></p>

<p>Do you mean an account of the various small wars?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Adene.</span></p>

<p>Well, chiefly all that came before the wars; the intrigues, and the
motives&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Vera.</span></p>

<p>Isn't it all in the Blue Books?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Adene.</span></p>

<p>Of course, but the point is&mdash;&mdash; <span class="ex">[<i>Pauses with a smile.</i></span></p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Vera.</span></p>

<p>Don't be afraid!</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Adene.</span></p>

<p>If you take the Blue Books, the natives always seem to be in the first
place treacherous criminals&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And also insanely blind to their own interests; which even savages are
not!&nbsp;&nbsp;[<span class="smcap">Vera</span> <i>laughs as if beaten</i>.]&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the English mind already; I
want to get inside the Bhoj&#226;li mind.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Vera.</span></p>

<p>It is like the programme of a Baboo Protection Society. I hope the
officials will like it.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Adene.</span></p>

<p>I have thought of that. But I know too much of India to be even
suspected of thinking ill of the officials. And Sir David's
recommendation will soften them.</p>

<p>First that I was reckless the other day to talk as I did, and quote that

high and clear standard, and never swerve from it without cause. I am

because I am seldom afraid. But, once or twice, here and there, when
things were different, I have never been turned from my purpose by the
mere nervous horror of a crime that most men feel; and where the first
step led to a second and a third, I have gone on without flinching.</p>

seldom, broken through what people call justice. But when I did&mdash;where
other men would flinch and prevaricate, I lied and swore false oaths.
Where they would connive at wrong occurring, I did the wrong with my own
hands, and cleared away the evidence of it. My own people in Bhoj&#226;l knew
me; they told in their songs how I could give the tiger fresh hunger and
the cobra poison; but they said too, "Best to be in the hand of God,
next best in the hand of Kal&#375;ona Sahib."</p>

<p class="direct"><i>In front of a Bungalow in the Ghautgherry Hills; the Bungalow with
its veranda occupies the left half of the stage; the rest is
Compound, with thick trees at the right. A door in the centre of
the veranda leads into the house; another, at the left, leads to</i>
<span class="smcap">Adene's</span> <i>sick-room. In front, to the right</i>, <span class="smcap">Adene</span> <i>is reclining in
a long Singapore chair with cushions. Just above him a table,
covered with Bhoj&#226;lee curiosities which have just been taken from a
box. At the table is</i> <span class="smcap">Rheinhardt</span> <i>seated, looking at the objects.
Behind is</i> <span class="smcap">Selim</span>, <i>an old native with one arm, dusting the veranda
with a feather mop</i>.</p>

<p class="direct"><span class="smcap">Adene</span> <i>has a Bhoj&#226;lee belt in his hands, with empty sheath</i>;
<span class="smcap">Rheinhardt</span> <i>has the knife, and is examining it closely</i>.</p>

<p>The belt is said to have been Koreb's own. There is nothing particular
about the knife&mdash;an ordinary Bhoj&#226;l kukri.</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Rheinhardt.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Holding the knife up for the light to strike its edge.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they use
poisoned knives in Bhoj&#226;l?</p>

<p class="char"><span class="smcap">Adene.</span></p>

<p>They have the secret; but I never heard of its being used in war, except
in the last war, against us.&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He sits up and reaches for the knife,
which</i> <span class="smcap">Rheinhardt</span> <i>gives</i>.]&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you see anything that looks like poison?</p>

<p>Come, come!&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Presses him down in the chair.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;If I let you come outside
the veranda, you must be content to lie still.&mdash;Selim, two pegs lower.

said, "If I had the right assistant, I could save Adene." But I had him
not. I wanted&mdash;ah, so many things! You will not understand: a doctor who
should be also a nurse, who should know my ways&mdash;and more. There was

die." I had nothing to give; only a little broken end of life. But I
said, "That at least shall be hers. I will work for her these last
months; I will pile up my little monument to her father's greatness, and
die building it."</p>

Elizabeth, who has lost her very soul, and cannot see that there is any
human being in the world but you?</p>

mad!</p>

<p>Afraid? No. But I have not finished living. Do you think I am an old
man? There is as much blood and muscle in my arms as there ever was. I
feel life leaping in every limb. I won't kill myself. No! nor let
another man kill me! And I won't bear that penance either. There are
other places besides England and British India.</p>

story against mine?&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>She is silent. A slight pause.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;But suppose I
confess all. Suppose I stand up straight before all Englishmen and bid
them judge me: "Here I am: I have broken rules and treaties; I have
fought with all weapons; I have had no law nor conscience nor pity&mdash;for
your enemies! I am yours to chain or unchain; I am your fighting man,
your bloodhound, your leashed panther! Have you no use for me?" Do you
think, among all the swarming cowards that govern us, I shall not bring
a host to my side when I say that?</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
